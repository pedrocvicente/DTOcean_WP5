This module is part of the characterization step in the WP5 methodology. It 
contains feasibility functions to compute the minimum logistic requirements to 
carry out the different logistic phases. This particular modules includes the
function related to the installation of moorings and foundations.

BETA VERSION NOTES: The current version is limited to an installation strategy
consisting of installation of 1 set of foundations at the time. This will be 
futher developed in the beta version due to October.

def MF_feas(log_phase, log_phase_id, wp2_outputs, wp4_outputs):
    """ wp4_feas is a function which determines the logistic requirement 
    associated with one logistic phase dealing with the installation of 
    moorings and foundation systems
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    log_phase : Class
     Class of the logistic phase under consideration for assessment
    log_phase_id : str
     string describing the ID of the logistic phase under consideration
    wp2_outputs : dict
     dictionnary containing all required inputs to WP5 coming from WP2
    wp4_outputs : DataFrame
     Panda table containing all required inputs to WP5 coming from WP4
    
    Returns
    -------
    feas_e : dict
     dictionnary containing all logistic requirements associated with every
     equipment type of the logistic phase under consideration
    feas_v : dict
     dictionnary containing all logistic requirements associated with every
     vessel type of the logistic phase under consideration
