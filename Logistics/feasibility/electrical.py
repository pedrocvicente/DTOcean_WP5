This module is part of the characterization step in the WP5 methodology. It 
contains feasibility functions to compute the minimum logistic requirements to 
carry out the different logistic phases. This particular modules includes the
function related to the installation of electrical infrastructure.

BETA VERSION NOTES: This module is still to be done.
